# Logo Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Accomplished

### 🎯 Logo Path Updates
Successfully replaced all base64 SVG logo references with actual image file references across **5 navigation components**:

- ✅ **Home Page** (`src/pages/home.js`)
- ✅ **Events Page** (`src/pages/events.js`) 
- ✅ **Programs Page** (`src/pages/programs.js`)
- ✅ **Dashboard Page** (`src/pages/dashboard.js`)
- ✅ **Edit Event Page** (`src/pages/edit-event.js`)

### 🎨 Brand Colors Already Integrated
Your logo's color palette is already fully integrated throughout the platform:

- **Green (#4a9d4a)**: Primary buttons, navigation active states
- **Brown (#8b5a3c)**: Secondary elements, stats cards  
- **Red (#c53030)**: Accent colors, error states, delete buttons
- **White (#ffffff)**: Backgrounds and text

### 📁 Current Logo Status
- **File**: `src/assets/logo.svg` 
- **Status**: Temporary placeholder showing three shields in your brand colors
- **Ready for**: Your actual logo image replacement

## 🔄 Next Action Required

**Replace the placeholder logo with your actual uploaded image:**

1. Save your logo image as `src/assets/logo.png` (or keep as `.svg`)
2. If using PNG, update file extensions in the 5 page files from `.svg` to `.png`
3. Your logo will immediately appear across all navigation bars
